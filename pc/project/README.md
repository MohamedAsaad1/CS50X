## description Dark mode:
A dark mode is a software option that makes the user interface darker. It changes light backgrounds to a dark color and changes the text from dark to light. The result is a pseudo-inverted interface that isn't exactly the opposite of the "light mode," but has mostly dark colors.
Dark mode, also "night mode," has been popular with developers for many years. Since developers stare at source code several hours a day, the dark background produces less eye strain. Recently, the dark mode has become a popular option for all end users since it is now a standard option for both 
There is no standard dark mode palette, so each developer can choose how to implement it. Some dark modes have dark grey themes, while others are almost black. Other versions have different hues, such as slate or dark blue. The option to switch to dark mode is typically located in the "General" or "Interface" section of a program's settings. It is also an option on some websites
but my extension is content dark mode all your page not section on your page
